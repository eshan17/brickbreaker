This was the first assignment in a brand new class called Cross-Platform Mobile Web Apps (15-237) at Carnegie Mellon. We had to create any game we wanted, so we created a game similar to the game known as brickbreaker. 
This is written in javascript, HTML5, and CSS3 and completely on the client-side.

You can download the source code and click on index.html to play the game.
